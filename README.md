# Task 6 – K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

## 📌 Overview
This task demonstrates how the KNN algorithm works for classification using the Iris dataset. The goal is to normalize features, train the model, experiment with different K values, evaluate performance, and visualize decision boundaries.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🧪 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Iris dataset  
2. Normalized features using StandardScaler  
3. Split data into training & testing sets  
4. Trained a KNN model  
5. Evaluated accuracy and confusion matrix  
6. Tested multiple K values to find the best K  
7. Visualized decision boundaries  

---

## 📊 Results
- Best K value: (depends on graph result)
- Final Model Accuracy: (insert accuracy from output)

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open Google Colab
2. Upload the notebook file
3. Run all cells in order
